			<head>Biography of Salazar Slytherin</head>
			<p>Salazar Slytherin was born in the first half of the tenth century, somewhere in
				fen-country England. Researchers believe it was likely Norfolk, Lincolnshire, or
				Cambridgeshire, but may have been a connected county. He came from a family of
				pure-blood wizards, although the names of his parents are not recorded. It is
				unknown whether he trained at a school of the time, at home, or under a master.
				Together with Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff, he founded the <expan
					abbr="HSWW">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</expan>.</p>
			<p>At Hogwarts, Slytherin taught Legilimency, the magical art of forming a mental
				connection with another's mind and extracting information or interacting with their
				thought processes. This may have been a genetic talent, as his descendent, Tom
				Riddle, was also a noted legilimens. Slytherin was also a Parselmouth, a known genet
				ic trait, and able to speak with snakes. He bred at least one basilisk, which he
				left at Hogwarts in the Chamber of Secrets. The Chamber remained unopened until
				1943, when Riddle opened it and used the basilisk to attack Muggle-borns. The
				basilisk was not killed until 1993.</p>
			<p>Slytherin believed that the school should only teach pure-blood students and should
				definitely not accept students whose parents were both Muggles. His own house,
				Slytherin, continued this tradition, but the other founders overruled him. After an
				argument with Godric Gryffindor, which may have involved a duel, Slytherin left the
				school.</p>
			<p>While it is not known when or where Slytherin died, one of his spell books and a
				final journal were recovered shortly before the turn of the twelfth century by
				Slytherin alumnus and professor Albert Shallowheart. It is assumed that Slytherin
				was dead when these books were recovered.</p>

			<p><emph render="bold">Series 2: Other Correspondence</emph> is Slytherin's
				correspondence with other witches and wizards. It includes letters received by
				Slytherin and left at Hogwarts on his departure as well as some letters which were
				donated later on by correspondents.</p>
			<p><emph render="bold">Series 3: Class Notes</emph> consists of Slytherin's notes for
				teaching classes on Legilimency, Charms, and Care of Magical Creatures.</p>
			<p><emph render="bold">Series 4: Journals</emph> is made up of four journals kept by

				Slytherin to record jinxes, dark charms, legilimency, spells for the control of
				basilisks, and the darkest arts.</p>

					<p>Based on the pattern of acquisition, Slytherin's spell books have been passed
						down through the Peverell and Gaunt families. It seems likely that Slytherin
						visisted one of more of his children and close friends after his departure
						from Hogwarts and left his spell books in their charge. By the point of his
						death, it seems unlikely that he would have had need for consulting
						reference materials as he was a highly-accomplished wizard. Early archivists
